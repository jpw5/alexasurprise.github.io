        <h2 class=red-text>Well here we go,</h2>
        <p>Roses are red, violets are blue, you are as beautiful as you are true. You make smile every morning and</p>
        <p>grin every night. I am blessed every day to have you in my sight. From your laugh to your walk, and the</p>
        <p>funny ways you talk, to your mere present that makes me want the day to never stop. You are 100% unapologetically</p>
        <p>yourself and that is much to respect, also the stalkerish staring is what I expect. It's really been 2 years </p>
        <p>boy does time fly, I look forward to a lifetime with you by my side. I know it's cheesy but it could be worse</p>
        <p>right?</p>
